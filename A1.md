# First Application: SplenDO

**Link to application:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo

SplenDO app comes under the Productivity category. It helps the user to manage their time in an efficient manner. The main idea of this app is to create various tasks for a day along with the start time. These created tasks can be grouped under user-defined categories. The categories may include Shopping, Work, and Personal to name a few. The app will notify the user about the upcoming tasks in advance. The time of notification can be set by the user as per the need.

One of the most important reasons for choosing this app is its simplicity. This app has the perfect amount of functions which makes it neither too complex nor too simple to be an app. It also has a very user-friendly graphical interface. It is also customizable to a certain extent in terms of notifications and task groups. It also gives functionality to create a quick task which requires only the name of the task. This helps users to add any task on the fly taking less than 5 seconds. The user may later edit it as per his/her convenience and update the other fields like notification time, task category, and others. SplenDO also allows users to enter tasks in a “Batch Mode”. The main idea is to enter multiple tasks which are linked to and dependent on one another. This functionality helps a user to divide a complex task into smaller sub-steps, helping them finish the task. SplenDO also allows adding tasks via voice. It also has notifications in the form of a speech synthesizer (Text to Speech).

The strengths of the application include multiple ways of adding a task, customizable notifications, and simple user interface. The disadvantage of this app is that there is no way to sync your schedule with the calendar of your email, audio-visual advertisements (for free version) which cover the full screen. It is important to work on these dis-advantages to improve the app. The app can be made with an option to synchronize the calendar. The advertisements should only have an image instead of an audio-visual. It is also a good idea to provide an optional field of end time, which would give the user a heads up if he/she is taking more time for that particular task to complete.



## First Heuristic Evaluation: Error prevention
The app is designed in a perfect way to avoid the slips and mistakes committed by the user [1]. Just as an example, if a user gives notification date past current date then it shows it in the red color font. This reminds the user politely that it is already past. The labels before the text boxes are well explained. This gives the user a clear idea of what is expected in the text fields. Also, the new task creation tab has a text field which at the top which requests for the name of the task followed by its due date and then the time. This decreases any kind of mistakes which may lead to an error on the user part.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Consistency and standards
The design of the app is consistent. The color scheme of the app is constant in the shade of blue and white. This color scheme makes the app professional and standard. The functional flow of the app is well structured keeping in mind the user’s thought process. The font color, type, size and face used gives the app a rich and professional look. Also, same font type is used throughout the app with almost no variation in font size.

# Second Application: FitMenCook – Healthy Recipes
**Link to application:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nibbleapps.fitmencook

The app FitMenCook – Healthy Recipes comes under the Food and Drink category. As the name suggests this app helps the user to maintain a healthy diet by guiding them starting from the ingredient shopping till the end dish is ready. It also helps to keep track of the calories intake per day. This app guides the user in the form of videos and text recipes on how to prepare a dish in the least amount of time with less expensive ingredients.

Cooking healthy food requires a lot of time. It also tastes bland. This is where FitMenCook – Healthy Recipes app comes in the picture. It helps the user to keep track of the ingredients that are needed to cook a dish. The app has a feature that allows the user to add the list of items in the “To shop” category which reminds the user to buy it from the store. The app also allows customizing the number of serves. It adjusts the ingredients automatically based on the number of serves. The quantity of ingredients is also customizable. The user may use grams or pounds depending on his/her preference. Every dish has a nutrition value which helps the user to keep track of the amount of the calories. It also allows the user to add these nutrition values to Google Fit. It has various recipes categorized under Vegan, Vegetarian, Breakfast, Budget, Snacks & Sweets and Post-workout to name a few. As these names are self-explanatory, we won’t discuss them in detail. The user can share his/her recipe via various apps (e.g., Whatsapp, Messenger, and others).

After analyzing the app, it can be observed that the app has some strengths and weaknesses. The strengths are the user-friendliness, quick response time, easy to start using it, instant access to the recipes needed, smart categorization of the recipes, internationalization (currently supports Spanish). It takes more than expected time to play any video. The full-screen option lags during video playback. The app can be improved by creating a user profile which may help a user track the history of the food he/she had since the start date of using the app. It is a good idea to provide a dashboard with different dimensions to compare against different types of metrics.

## First Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and the real world
The app’s landing screen is very neat and designed to display recently viewed items followed by the categories of the dishes if the user is already connected the Google fit. This order makes perfect sense from the end user perspective. The Category of dishes has perfect names which are self-explanatory as they have a resemblance to the real-world terms. The search icon placed on top of the home screen makes it clear that one can search for the recipes. The symbols for Favorites, Settings, Recipes, Shopping List, and others are relevant to their names. They are simple to identify for the user.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Consistency and standard
The logo of the app is not consistent. The launching icon has a light orange colored background, while the landing page has a white background. This variation in the logo leads to an unprofessional design. Also, the red colored tabs do not mix with the logo. It needs to be improved. The advertisements are not consistent with shape and size throughout the app. The font type and size are consistent throughout the app. But, the text is bold at the top while it is not at the bottom of the same text.
